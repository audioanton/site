<p>
    I love games! I specialize in creating dynamic, unique and customizable sound design and music. Working closely with the team, I go all out to create immersive soundscapes, always true to the game’s essential spirit. Dependable and communicative, I bring a spark of joy, creativity, and playfulness to a project that surrounds not only the audio but the entire game!

    For me, gaming is about fun, creativity, and exploration. Whether it’s a gritty dungeon crawler or a calming world builder, games offer endless opportunities for play and storytelling (…and sometimes bottomless frustration!). Sound is crucial in shaping a game’s narrative and atmosphere, adding depth to the experience. Game development takes dedication and endurance, and I am passionate about enhancing that labor of love with audio that captures the heart of its vision.
