A lot of small steps have been taken for the website!

Pagination for the blog and a lot of styling. It's really coming along nicely, I'm quite obsessed.

And I have started looking into a way to format and create posts for my social media automatically by scraping this blog. My idea is to use python and so far I've tested it with the Facebook API. Since I am very lazy when it comes to posting this is very exciting! 

If you are curious I've checked out these repositories that I will draw a **lot** of inspiration from.
- **[python-facebook](https://github.com/sns-sdks/python-facebook/tree/master)**
    *- A python package for the facebook API*
- **[python-github-action-template](https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-github-action-template)**
    *- An example for automating python scripts with github actions*
