I've started learning Go (Golang?) with a [great guide](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests). I am looking forward to improving my testing workflow. Also my old website is officially dead. This is now the place to be. I have a lot of ideas of what I want to achieve with it, but we'll see how that progresses. There are a lot of things I want to implement, but some are a bit tricky without any backend, like a contact form. As they say, "Perfection is the enemy of progress". That's what they say right? Anyway that is my motto for this website. Have a great summer!
