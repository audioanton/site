I published my new mini-ep today titled <strong>["Roboson"](https://audioanton.bandcamp.com/album/roboson)</strong>. It's three super sweet songs that I actually finished some time ago. The ep is now live at my brand new [bandcamp account](https://audioanton.bandcamp.com/album/roboson). I also started to dabble in pixel art. It's really fun also. So the little figure you see is my own creation. But I don't think I've landed on a final design for either the pixel art, album title or track titles. So we'll see if it changes. Feel free to give it a listen.
