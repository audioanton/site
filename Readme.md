My personal website where I plan to display my music and blog. Under development with jekyll, feel free to suggest improvements, this is a learning expericence.

### Potential features:
- embed my music via soundcloud
- add a cdn for sounds/images/other [cloudflare?](https://www.cloudflare.com/sv-se/application-services/products/cdn/) 
- add a contact form without backend somehow
- pagination for blog [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
- make navigation a burger menu for mobile

### Todos:
- add posters for videos so the page loads faster
- fix listen.html: add music and player..
- fix blog, add images, pagination
