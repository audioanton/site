<p>Pagination for the blog and a lot of styling. It’s really coming along nicely, I’m quite obsessed.</p>

<p>And I have started looking into a way to format and create posts for my social media automatically by scraping this blog. My idea is to use python and so far I’ve tested it with the Facebook API. Since I am very lazy when it comes to posting this is very exciting!</p>

<p>If you are curious I’ve checked out these repositories that I will draw a <strong>lot</strong> of inspiration from.</p>

It’s three super sweet songs that I actually finished some time ago. The ep is now live at my brand new <a href="https://audioanton.bandcamp.com/album/roboson">bandcamp account</a>.</p>

<p>I also started to dabble in pixel art. It’s really fun also. So the little figure you see is my own creation. But I don’t think I’ve landed on a final design for either the pixel art, album title or track titles. So we’ll see if it changes. Feel free to give it a listen.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anton</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I published my new mini-ep today titled “Roboson”.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Go Is Go..od!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/site/2025/07/02/Go-is-Go/od!.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Go Is Go..od!" /><published>2025-07-02T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-07-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/site/2025/07/02/Go-is-Go/Go-is-Go..od!</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/site/2025/07/02/Go-is-Go/od!.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve started learning Go (Golang?) with a <a href="https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests">great guide</a>.
<!--more-->
I am looking forward to improving my testing workflow.</p>

<p>Also my old website is officially dead. This is now the place to be. I have a lot of ideas of what I want to achieve with it, but we’ll see how that progresses. There are a lot of things I want to implement, but some are a bit tricky without any backend, like a contact form. As they say, “Perfection is the enemy of progress”. That’s what they say right? Anyway that is my motto for this website. Have a great summer!</p>]]></content><author><name>Anton</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve started learning Go (Golang?) with a great guide.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Jekyll Is Awesome</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/site/2025/06/25/Jekyll-is-Awesome.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jekyll Is Awesome" /><published>2025-06-25T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-06-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/site/2025/06/25/Jekyll-is-Awesome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/site/2025/06/25/Jekyll-is-Awesome.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned about Jekyll with this awesome <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a>.
